## Quick Start

### Step 1: Export from TailwindCSS

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

The JSON should have been exported.

### Step 2: Import to Figma

To install the plugin:

-   Open Figma, go to Plugins -> Manage plugins.
-   In the development section, click on the '+' button to add a new plugin.
-   Select the manifest.json file from the downloaded/cloned repository.
-   Once the plugin is installed, you can use it to import or export variables directly from/to Figma.

## Features
